# Pseudo 3d Road Example
## Example code
This repository contains a Lua and LÃ–VE implementation of a pseudo 3d road, using the technique described on http://www.extentofthejam.com/pseudo/. The code was created by reducing the code of game https://github.com/Foppygames/max-downforce to an example containing just the scrolling road and horizon. More explanation can be found in comments in the code.
## Video
A video of the scrolling road can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T45J8K0mzkY
## Contributing
Since this is meant as a compact example of just a pseudo 3d road, contributions that add features are not fitting for this repository. It is better to create a new repository that takes this code as a starting point. Thank you for your interest!
