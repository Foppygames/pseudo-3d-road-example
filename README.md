# Pseudo 3d Road Example

This repository contains a Lua and LÃ–VE implementation of a pseudo 3d road, using the technique described on http://www.extentofthejam.com/pseudo/. The code was created by reducing the code of game https://github.com/Foppygames/max-downforce to an example containing just the scrolling road and horizon. More explanation can be found in comments in the code.
